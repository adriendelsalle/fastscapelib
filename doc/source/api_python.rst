Python API Reference
====================

Fastscapelib Python bindings are built with pybind11_ and
xtensor-python_. Although there is not yet comprehensive documentation
for the Python API, it closely matches the C++ API (see
:ref:`api_cpp`). Python functions accept numpy_ arrays instead of
``xtensor`` arrays.
